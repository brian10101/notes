to summarize my new findings: I will be using Quart since for my use case where I will be creating a control panel that uses websockets for live updates Quart is better since Quart is a Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface(ASGI) and natively supports websockets unlike frameworks like flask that use Web Server Gateway Interface(WSGI) a older technology and was created before webscokets, and is unable to support websockets it only supports synchronous HTTP 1.x request/ response cycles meaning that it can only send or receive data at once and not do both aka do bidirectional commication or keep a connection open which are must haves for websockets.
